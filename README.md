## 📈 Time Series EDA: Tesla Stock Analysis

This notebook presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Tesla's stock price data using time series techniques. The key objectives are to uncover patterns, identify trends and seasonality, and prepare the data for future forecasting or modeling.

### 🔍 Key Features:

* Data retrieval from Yahoo Finance using `pandas_datareader`
* Time-based resampling (`monthly`, `quarterly`, `annually`) for trend analysis
* Rolling statistics (moving averages) for smoothing
* Visualizations to examine seasonality, trends, and volatility
* Insightful plots using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

### 📦 Libraries Used:

* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `pandas_datareader`
* `datetime`

### 📊 Outcome:

By the end of this EDA, we gain an intuitive understanding of Tesla stock price behavior across different time scales and prepare the data for potential forecasting models like ARIMA or LSTM.
